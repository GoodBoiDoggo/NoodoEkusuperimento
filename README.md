## Usage

If you are a male user, all you need to do is clone the project.

If you are a female user, send 5 legit selfies to the project master before cloning the project.

 and make sure to install the dependencies.
 
 ```
 npm install
 ```


## Developing

### Nodemon

You may install software like Nodemon to make life easier.
This method of installing is deprecated:
```
npm install nodemon --save -dev
```
Instead, use this method:
```
npm install nodemon --save --only=dev
```
For some reason, di sha ma save sa package.json as a dev dependecy. Bsin kailangan pa i type manually.

### Running the app with nodemon

To run the project using nodemon, open cmd or the terminal window of eclipse(Monitor icon at the upper left),
then run this command:
```
npm start
```
This works kay gichange nako ang "start" na property sa package.json
